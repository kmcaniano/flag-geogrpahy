# Flag Geography

This goal of this project is to play around with React and improve my geography skills. This is a long term project that I plan on adding on to in the future. 

The application provides a random country's flag and the user must identify the flag on the provided map. The mapping functionality is built using Datamaps (https://datamaps.github.io/).

You can access the application by going to https://flag-geography.herokuapp.com
